# :speech_balloon: Morse Code Translater 

This repository is about a simple GUI program made with Tkinter (python's standart GUI package) which translates text to morse code and vice-versa. It has both English (en-us) and Portuguese (pt-br) versions.

# :rocket: Features

- Encrypt text to morse code
- Decrypt morse code to normal text
- Choose between English (en-us) or Portuguese (pt-br)


# :clipboard: Requirements

> Python 3.6 or greater 

You don't have to install anything else besides Python since TKinter is pre-installed by default, but if necessary, run `python -m pip install tkinter` in order to install the package.

Check the [requirements.txt][requirements] to see exactly what I've used

# :running: Running the program

Since this project focuses on the simplicity, only one command is necessary to start the program (make sure to be in the project directory):

> `python -m morse` 


# :chart_with_upwards_trend: Next Steps

I want to continually improve this program even though it's very simple, so these are the main things I will update or include in the future:

- CLI options
- Prettify the GUI
- Fix bugs
